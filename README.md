# animated-gifs
Huge collection of the animated gifs I use on http://tumblr.snipe.net and in my other Github issues/pull requests to make contributing more fun.

Yes, I know a few of them are not actually gifs. Quiet, you.

**Note: This repo is big. It has ~2k animated gifs, and they're all awesome, but it's big and it will take some time to download/clone.**

I'll be working on categorizing the ones that are not currently categorized over time, and renaming them all to something that actually means something. I need to do this for my own sanity (and so I can find the right gif when I need it), but it will take a little time to get everything categorized and appropriately named.

The copyrights to the actual images belong to their respective intellectual property copyright holders, blah blah blah. I have collected these over a period of years, so I couldn't tell you where I found most of them, and I'm reasonably certain the folks I nicked them from couldn't tell you where they originally found them either. Internet, amirite?

If you dig it and want to buy me a beer or a cup of coffee, you can do so with [Changetip](https://www.changetip.com/tipme/snipe). You don't have to, but it's always appreciated.

Enjoy!
